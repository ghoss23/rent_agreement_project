# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Rent Agreement. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Still to create seperate javascript files for each function, frontend.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js
```
